Today at an advanced age, almost retired, I started programming and followed the birth of Windows,
before I used DOS and Basic as programming on K7 tape, in Brazil we had video text and later BBS Bulletin board system or better Bulletin board server.
I'm unpretentious and thinking about writing a few lines, testing some database solutions, 
styles and in general seeing in the big picture what advanced and became accessible to everyone. 
I've worked with several segments over the years, if I make a short list, the number of projects, 
platforms and systems I've learned can be very funny. Hardware and Software, in the past, everything that appeared was soon consumed, 
fortunately I always had access to a lot of technology, today I have all platforms in my "setup", 
however, I no longer have DOS installation disks (kkk). So let's see how I'm going to go out and do it again with some codes :-). 
I forgot, my English is terrible, I only read (kkk), I always use a translator, I don't dare write except code in English, 
I mix a lot of German with English even in conversation.
